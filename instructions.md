# Usage

This guide describes the necessary steps to deploy Wazuh on Kubernetes.

## Pre-requisites

- Kubernetes cluster already deployed.
- Kubernetes can run on a wide range of Cloud providers and bare-metal environments, this repository focuses on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). It was tested using [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks). You should be able to:
    - Create Persistent Volumes on top of AWS EBS when using a volumeClaimTemplates
    - Create a record set in AWS Route 53 from a Kubernetes LoadBalancer.
- Having at least two Kubernetes nodes in order to meet the *podAntiAffinity* policy.


## Overview

### StateFulSet and Deployments Controllers

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container specification, but it maintains an identity attached to each of its pods. These pods are created from the same specification, but they are not interchangeable: each one has a persistent identifier maintained across any rescheduling.

It is useful for stateful applications like databases that save the data to a persistent storage. The states of each Wazuh manager as well as Elasticsearch are desirable to maintain, so we declare them using StatefulSet to ensure that they maintain their states in every startup.

Deployments are intended for stateless use and are quite lightweight and seem to be appropriate for Logstash, Kibana and Nginx, where it is not necessary to maintain the states.

### Pods

#### Wazuh master

This pod contains the master node of the Wazuh cluster. The master node centralizes and coordinates worker nodes, making sure the critical and required data is consistent across all nodes.
The management is performed only in this node, so the agent registration service (authd) and the API are placed here.

Details:
- Image: Docker Hub 'wazuh/wazuh:3.7.0_6.5.0'
- Controller: StatefulSet

#### Wazuh worker 0 / 1

These pods contain a worker node of the Wazuh cluster. They will receive the agent events.

Details:
- Image: Docker Hub 'wazuh/wazuh:3.7.0_6.5.0'
- Controller: StatefulSet


#### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch pod. It receives and stores alerts received from Logstash. No Elasticsearch cluster is supported yet.

Details:
- Image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.0
- Controller: StatefulSet


#### Logstash

Logstash pod. It receives the alerts from each Filebeat located in every Wazuh manager. Then, the alerts are sent to Elasticsearch.

Details:
- image: Docker Hub 'wazuh/logstash:3.7.0_6.5.0'
- Controller: Deployment


#### Kibana

Kibana pod. It lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data, along with other features as the Wazuh app.

Details:
- image: Docker Hub 'wazuh/kibana:3.7.0_6.5.0'
- Controller: Deployment

#### Nginx

The nginx pod acts as a reverse proxy for a safer access to Kibana.

Details:
- image: Docker Hub 'wazuh/nginx:3.7.0_6.5.0'
- Controller: Deployment


### Services

#### Elastic stack

- wazuh-elasticsearch:
  - Communication for Elasticsearch nodes.
- elasticsearch:
  - Elasticsearch API. Used by Logstash/Kibana to write/read alerts.
- wazuh-nginx:
  - Nginx proxy to access Kibana: https://wazuh.your-domain.com:443
- kibana:
  - Kibana service.
- Logstash:
  - Logstash service, each Manager node has a Filebeat pointing to this service.

#### Wazuh

- wazuh:
  - Wazuh API: wazuh-master.your-domain.com:55000
  - Agent registration service (authd): wazuh-master.your-domain.com:1515
- wazuh-workers:
  - Reporting service: wazuh-manager.your-domain.com:1514
- wazuh-cluster:
  - Communication for Wazuh manager nodes.


## Deploy


### Step 1: Deploy Kubernetes

Deploying the Kubernetes cluster is out of the scope of this guide.

This repository focuses on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) but it should be easy to adapt it to another Cloud provider. In case you are using AWS, we recommend [EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).


### Step 2: Create domains to access the services

We recommend creating domains and certificates to access the services. Examples:

- wazuh-master.your-domain.com: Wazuh API and authd registration service.
- wazuh-manager.your-domain.com: Reporting service.
- wazuh.your-domain.com: Kibana and Wazuh app.

Note: You can skip this step and the services will be accessible using the Load balancer DNS from the VPC.

### Step 3: Deployment

Clone this repository to deploy the necessary services and pods.

```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kubernetes.git
$ cd wazuh-kubernetes
```

### Step 3.1: Wazuh namespace and StorageClass

The Wazuh namespace is used to handle all the Kubernetes elements (services, deployments, pods) necessary for Wazuh. In addition, you must create a StorageClass to use AWS EBS storage in our StateFulSet applications.

```BASH
$ kubectl apply -f base/wazuh-ns.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f base/aws-gp2-storage-class.yaml
```

### Step 3.2: Deploy Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch deployment.

```BASH
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-svc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-api-svc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-sts.yaml
```

### Step 3.3: Deploy Kibana and Nginx

Kibana and Nginx deployment.

In case you need to provide a domain name, update the `domainName` annotation value in the [nginx-svc.yaml](elastic_stack/kibana/nginx-svc.yaml) file before deploying that service. You should also set a valid AWS ACM certificate ARN in the [nginx-svc.yaml](elastic_stack/kibana/nginx-svc.yaml) for the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert` annotation. That certificate should match with the `domainName`.

```BASH
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/kibana/kibana-svc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/kibana/nginx-svc.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/kibana/kibana-deploy.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/kibana/nginx-deploy.yaml
```

### Step 3.4: Deploy Logstash

Logstash deployment.

```BASH
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/logstash/logstash-svc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f elastic_stack/logstash/logstash-deploy.yaml
```

### Step 3.5: Deploy Wazuh

Wazuh cluster deployment.

In case you need to provide a domain name, update the `domainName` annotation value in both the [wazuh-master-svc.yaml](wazuh_managers/wazuh-master-svc.yaml) and the [wazuh-workers-svc.yaml](wazuh_managers/wazuh-workers-svc.yaml) files before deploying those services. You should also set a valid AWS ACM certificate ARN in the [wazuh-master-svc.yaml](wazuh_managers/wazuh-master-svc.yaml) for the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert` annotation. That certificate should match with the `domainName`.


```BASH
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-master-svc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-cluster-svc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-workers-svc.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-master-conf.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-worker-0-conf.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-worker-1-conf.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-master-sts.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-worker-0-sts.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wazuh_managers/wazuh-worker-1-sts.yaml
```

### Verifying the deployment

```

#### Deployments

```BASH
$ kubectl get deployments -n wazuh
NAME             DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```

#### Statefulsets

```BASH
$ kubectl get statefulsets -n wazuh
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE

wazuh-nginx-748fb8494f-xwwhw      1/1       Running   0          14m
```

#### Accessing Kibana

In case you created domain names for the services, you should be able to access Kibana using the proposed domain name: https://wazuh.your-domain.com.

Also, you can access using the External-IP (from the VPC): https://internal-xxx-yyy.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:443

```BASH
$ kubectl get services -o wide -n wazuh
NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                                       PORT(S)                          AGE       SELECTOR
wazuh-nginx           LoadBalancer   xxx.xx.xxx.xxx   internal-xxx-yyy.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com                                      80:31831/TCP,443:30974/TCP       15m       app=wazuh-nginx
```

## Agents

### Monitoring hosts

Wazuh agents are designed to monitor hosts. Just register the agent using the registration service, then configure the agent to use the reporting service.

### Monitoring containers

In this case, we have 2 options:

- Running the agent in the container: containers are sealed and designed to run a single process. It is not practicable solution.
- Install the agent on the host: This is the option that we recommend since the agent was originally designed for this purpose.

We are researching if the agent is able to run as a *DaemonSet* container. A *DaemonSet* is a special type of Pod which is logically guaranteed to run on each Kubernetes node. This kind of agent will have access only to its container, so we should mount volumes used by other containers to monitor logs, files, etc.
